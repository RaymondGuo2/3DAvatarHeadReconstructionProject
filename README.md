# Repository for Raymond Guo's Individual Project

This is the official repository for Raymond Guo's MSc Computing Individual Project titled "Transforming 2D Images into 3D Child Avatars - Enhancing Self-Attachment Technique with 3D Reconstruction".  

This repository represents the collection of all the individual experiments and implementations that were carried out during the project, and is thus structured as the main module to multiple git submodules. More context to the submodules can be discovered by entering the respective repositories, and referencing with the individual project report's methodology and implementation sections. 

Many thanks are given to Professor Abbas Edalat and Xinyan Ye for their help and guidance during this project period.
